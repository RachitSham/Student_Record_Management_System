# Student Record Management System !!

ğŸš€   Code Flow Of the Project:-

âœ… Start of Program:

ğŸ”¹ Main method starts and runs an infinite loop using a boolean flag (running = true).

ğŸ”¹ Displays a menu to the user with 5 options: Add, View, Update, Delete, Exit.

âœ… Menu Options Logic (Switch Case):

ğŸ”¹ Based on user's input, the program routes control to appropriate static methods:

ğŸ”¹ addStudent() â€” Collects input, creates a Student object, adds it to ArrayList.

ğŸ”¹ viewStudents() â€” Loops through list and prints all student details.

ğŸ”¹ updateStudent() â€” Finds student by ID and updates name/marks.

ğŸ”¹ deleteStudent() â€” Finds student by ID and deletes the record using an iterator.

ğŸ”¹ Exit â€” Terminates the loop and closes the Scanner.

âœ… Data Storage:

ğŸ”¹ Student records are stored in a static ArrayList<Student> which holds all data in memory.

ğŸ”¹ No database or file I/O â€” keeping it simple and focused on logic.

ğŸ”¹I used ChatGPT to refine the grammar and structure of the key points explaining my code.

ğŸ”¹ Additionally, I referred to GeeksforGeeks [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org] for conceptual guidance and coding references to ensure clarity and correctness in my implementation.
